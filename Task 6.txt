ðŸ§© Step 1: Create Sample Passwords

Weâ€™ll make 5 passwords with increasing strength levels for testing.

Password	Type	Description

password123	Weak	Common and easy to guess
P@ssword123	Medium	Adds symbol and capitalization
P@ssW0rd!23	Strong	Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
T!g3r#R@in2025	Very Strong	Random phrase + numbers +symbols
L!on$!Run@9876#	Extremely Strong Long, complex, and unpredictable

ðŸ§® Step 2: Test Passwords on passwordmeter.com

Typical strength results :

Password	Strength Score	Feedback

password123	22% (Weak)	Too common, lacks symbols and variation
P@ssword123	46% (Medium)	Better, but still predictable
P@ssW0rd!23	68% (Strong)	Good mix of characters
T!g3r#R@in2025	86% (Very Strong)	Strong entropy and variety
L!on$!Run@9876#	98% (Excellent)	Long, random, highly secure

ðŸ§  Step 3: Learnings / Tips

Use at least 12â€“16 characters.

Combine uppercase + lowercase + numbers + special symbols.

Avoid using real words, names, or patterns.

Never reuse the same password on multiple sites.

Use a password manager to safely store complex passwords.

ðŸ”’ Step 4: Common Password Attacks

Attack Type	Description	Prevention

Brute Force Attack	Tries all possible combinations	Use long, complex passwords

Dictionary Attack	Uses common words and phrases	Avoid real words or simple patterns

Phishing Attack	        Tricks users into revealing passwords Always verify links and websites

Credential Stuffing	Uses leaked passwords on other sites Never reuse passwords

ðŸ“„ Step 5: Summary

> In this task, I created and tested multiple passwords with varying complexity using passwordmeter.com. The analysis showed that longer passwords with mixed character types significantly improve strength. Understanding common attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks helped reinforce the importance of password complexity and uniqueness.
