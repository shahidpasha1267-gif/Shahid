Procedure

1. Selected a VPN Service

Chose a reputable free VPN provider (e.g., ProtonVPN Free Tier).

Created a free account for secure login.


2. Downloaded and Installed the VPN Client

Downloaded the official VPN application from the provider’s website.

Installed the client successfully on the system.


3. Connected to a VPN Server

Opened the VPN app and logged in.

Selected a nearby VPN server for better speed and stability.

Clicked Connect to establish a secure tunnel.


4. Verified IP Address Change

Opened whatismyipaddress.com before and after connection.

Observed that the IP address and location changed after VPN connection — confirming successful tunneling.


5. Tested Secure Browsing

Accessed a few websites while connected.

Verified that traffic was encrypted and browsing was stable.


6. Disconnected VPN and Compared

Disconnected from the VPN and rechecked IP.

Noted that the IP returned to the original local address.

Observed minor differences in browsing speed (slightly slower when VPN was active).


7. Researched VPN Security

Learned that VPNs use encryption protocols (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2) to secure data transfer.

Understood how VPNs help protect against tracking, ISP monitoring, and geo-restrictions.
