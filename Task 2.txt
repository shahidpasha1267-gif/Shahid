1. Title
Internship Report — Identifying Phishing Characteristics in Emails

2. Intern Details
Name: Shahid Pasha

3. Purpose
This report documents the identification of phishing indicators in a suspicious email sample. The objective is to analyze email content, headers, links, and sender information to recognize common phishing traits, enhancing awareness of email security threats.

4. Tools
- Email client or saved email file (text or .eml)  
- Free online email header analyzer (e.g., MXToolbox, Google Admin Toolbox)  
- Optional: web browser to verify URLs safely in a controlled environment  

5. Environment / Setup
- Sample phishing emails obtained from free online resources (e.g., Anti-Phishing Working Group, PhishTank).  
- Emails were opened in a controlled environment to prevent accidental clicks on malicious links.  
- Headers extracted from email client or raw email file and analyzed using online tools.  

6. Tasks Performed

6.1 Examine sender’s email address
- Checked for discrepancies in the sender domain vs legitimate domain.  
- Looked for slight misspellings or extra characters (e.g., `support@paypal-secure.com` vs `support@paypal.com`).  

6.2 Analyze email headers
- Used online header analyzer to trace the route and verify originating IP.  
- Checked for discrepancies in SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication results.  

6.3 Inspect links and attachments
- Hovered over all links to check actual URL vs displayed text.  
- Did not click links; noted suspicious links (e.g., URLs with random characters, different domain, or IP-based URLs).  
- Checked attachment types — suspicious types included `.exe`, `.zip`, `.scr`.  

6.4 Evaluate email content
- Identified urgent or threatening language prompting immediate action (e.g., “Your account will be locked,” “Click immediately”).  
- Checked for mismatched greetings or unexpected personalization.  
- Noted spelling, grammar errors, or unusual formatting.  

7. Observations / Phishing Indicators Found
- Sender address: appeared spoofed with slight domain variation.  
- Header analysis: originating IP did not match claimed service provider; SPF/DKIM failed.  
- Links: URL mismatched displayed text; redirected to suspicious domain.  
- Attachment: included `.zip` file with potential risk.  
- Email body: contained urgent language and minor spelling/grammar errors.  

8. Summary of Findings
- The email displayed multiple classic phishing characteristics: sender spoofing, header anomalies, suspicious links, unsafe attachment, urgent messaging, and spelling mistakes.  
- These traits confirm that the sample email is likely a phishing attempt.  

9. Ethical Considerations
- Sample emails were analyzed in a controlled environment.  
- No malicious links or attachments were executed.  
- Analysis conducted for educational purposes only.  

10. Conclusion
This exercise improved understanding of phishing email characteristics, helping to identify suspicious emails and mitigate security risks. Continued practice with phishing samples strengthens practical email security awareness.
